# Golang Practice Lab by Rahul ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Go language practice repository**!  
This is my personal learning lab where I explore Golang concepts in depth â€” each topic is on its **own branch** with explanations, examples, and assignments.

The goal is to build a **comprehensive Golang reference** while showcasing my coding style, problem-solving skills, and ability to write clean, maintainable code.
